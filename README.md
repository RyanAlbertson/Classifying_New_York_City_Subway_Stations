_My submission for Coursera's IBM Applied Data Science Capstone course final project._

I used a geographical [dataset](./resources/NYC_Subway_Station_Coordinates.csv) of New York City subway stations 
along with the [FourSquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/places) to:
* Categorize all stations based upon their surrounding venues.
* Use k-means clustering to explore possible correlations of interest.
This information could be useful for city planners to predict the amount of traffic during certain times at
specific subway stations and their surrounding areas.
