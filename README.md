_My submission for Coursera's IBM Applied Data Science Capstone course final project._

I used a geographical [dataset](./resources/"NYC Subway Station Coordinates.csv") of New York City subway stations 
along with the [FourSquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/places) to:
* Categorize all stations based upon their surrounding venues.
* Use k-means clustering to explore possible correlations of interest.
